- [x] Allow haskemd to take in arrays of floats
- [ ] Fix python code so that converting to/from floats isn't so slow - perhaps by taking in the multiplier as an argument, or inferring it from size
- [ ] Allow custom functions in matrix generation (not just hammingDistance)
- [x] Document indices/auto-generated matrix relationship
- [x] Add an option for compiling sequential code using Data.Array.Accelerate.Interpreter
- [ ] Test on Mac (and Windows, though less important)
- [ ] Write documentation on windows setup (and imagemagick for Mac)
- [ ] Stop using imagemagick to convert python's bitmaps for Haskell's use
- [ ] Add paper on algorithm
- [x] Figure out difference between my computed value and theirs
- [ ] Figure out uniformity requirements for a constant factor
- [ ] Add documentation on calibration for other metrics. make a program
- [x] Make a table or something for factor w.r.t. variance and node number
- [ ] make equalize method take right number
- [x] Fix documentation so that sinks, sources are actually distributions
